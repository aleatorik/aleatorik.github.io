<h1 id="not-expect">Not expect</h1>

<p>Efficiency of Learning is highly increased because of modern facility
Write a line of code by others</p>

<p>‘Still to do (during the months)
Coding all by yourself
Study Algorithm &amp; Data Structure and practice of solving problems for interview</p>

<p>‘Still not to do (during the months)
Distrust what I learn(Tech, Mento, System)from Bootcamp
Other things such as outdoor sports, studying German, Using SNS, Consuming unnecessary contents</p>

<p><em>This approach is considered with an opportunity cost</em>
What if Self-preparation for job market is failed and take another three months afterwards? - Age matters a lot in this country.
Furthermore, if the possibility of entering good company with the bootcamp is higher than starting work few months earlier all by myself, the cost will be offset by the time I get done with my job for three months. So it’s basically the exchange money for time.</p>

- O(log n)은 O(n)보다 빠르다. 리스트의 원소의 개수가 증가하면 상대적으로 더 빨라진다.
- 알고리즘의 속도는 시간이 아니라 연산 횟수가 어떻게 증가하는지로 측정한다.
- 이렇게 하면 입력 데이터의 크기가 늘어날 때 알고리즘의 실행 속도가 얼마나 증가하는지 알 수 있다
- 알고리즘의 시간은 빅오 표기법으로 나타낸다.
