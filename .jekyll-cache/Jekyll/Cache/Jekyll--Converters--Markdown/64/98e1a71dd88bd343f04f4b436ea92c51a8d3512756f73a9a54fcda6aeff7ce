<p>What if Self-preparation for job market is failed and take another three months afterwards? <br />- Age matters a lot in this country.<br />
Furthermore, if the possibility of entering good company with the bootcamp is higher than starting work few months earlier all by myself, the cost will be offset by the time I get done with my job for three months. So itâ€™s basically the exchange money for time.</p>
