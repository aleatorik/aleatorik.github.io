# Expect

> - Collaboration in Agile way: Two times of team projects with required Skills
> - (Such as ES6, React, Redux, SPA, Sass, Node.js, Express.js and unit test(Enzyme), maybe React Native as well)
> - Code Review from experienced programmers

# Not expect

> - Efficiency of Learning is highly increased because of modern facility
> - Write a line of code by others

# Still to do (during the months)

> - Coding all by yourself
> - Study Algorithm & Data Structure and practice of solving problems for interview

# Still not to do (during the months)

> - Distrust what I learn(Tech, Mento, System) from Bootcamp
> - Other things such as outdoor sports, studying German, Using SNS, Consuming unnecessary contents

## _This approach is considered with an opportunity cost_

What if Self-preparation for job market is failed and take another three months afterwards? <br>- Age matters a lot in this country.<br>
Furthermore, if the possibility of entering good company with the bootcamp is higher than starting work few months earlier all by myself, the cost will be offset by the time I get done with my job for three months. So it's basically the exchange money for time. -->
